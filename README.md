## Introduction

### Objective

The objective of this project is as follows:
>You are required to create a service-orientated architecture for your application, this application must be composed of at least 4 services that work together.

To go into further detail, the 4 services should be comprised of:
- A core front-end service that will communicate with the other three services, and input some data into a database.
- Two back end services that will generate a random object.
- One back end service that will generate a object based on the randomly generated object from the other two back end services.

In addition, the project is expected to utilise the following technologies:
- Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board
- Version Control: Git
- CI Server: Jenkins
- Configuration Management: Ansible
- Cloud server: GCP virtual machines
- Containerisation: Docker
- Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
- Reverse Proxy: NGINX
